The First Perpetual NFT Exchange is Fixel.
Trade CryptoPunk, BAYC, Doodle, and other top NFT collections with up to 20x leverage

# Inspiration
The lack of liquidity in the NFT market limit participants from trading NFTs at the desired size, timing and price. Such liquidity issue occurs due to NFTsâ€™ innate attributes of non-fungibility and indivisibility. There are countless ongoing attempts to tackle such liquidity issue, with representative examples including NFTX which tokenizes NFTs into divisible ERC20 tokens. Nonetheless, NFTX is limited to floor price NFTs and has not been able to solve the liquidity component, thus remaining at a daily total volume of under 100 ETH.

Fixel introduces for the first time three groundbreaking concepts to the NFT market which are (1) Synthetic NFT Exchange; (2) PvP AMM; and (3) Synthetically Leveraged LP to become the First Perpetual NFT Exchange.

# What is Fixel?
